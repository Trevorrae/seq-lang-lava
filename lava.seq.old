#the first step is to mirror the input of data that lava takes for the preprocess function
import sys
import bio

#importing the fasta file - this should be the reference sequence
#todo make it switch the reference file to uppercase
#type K = Kmer[32]
##kset = list[K]()
#with bio.FASTQ(sys.argv[1]) as f:
#    for seq in seqs(f):
#        for kmer in seq.kmers[Kmer[32]](1):
#            if kmer not in kset:
#                kset.append(kmer)

#the next step is to import the list of known SNPs for the given genome
#this function is in the lava class dictgen.c at line 350 (make_snp_dict_)
#the folllowing are defined variables in the make_snp_dict function
#define CHROM_FIELD   1
#define INDEX_FIELD   2
#define STRAND_FIELD  6
#define REF1_FIELD    7
#define REF2_FIELD    8
#define ALT_FIELD     9
#define TYPE_FIELD    11
#define COUNT_FIELD   21
#define ALLELES_FIELD 22
#define FREQS_FIELD   24

#the first chunk of code in the function counts the number of lines in the file, i dont think we need to do this #todo : confirm - medium

#okay i need to actually run this puppy to see what im dealing with
#attempt #1
#this is the input command to run
#seqc lava.seq ~/lava/lava_files/SRR622461.filt.fastq ~/lava/lava_files/SNPs142_hg19_Common.filt.txt 
#or
#seqc lava.seq ~/lava/lava_files/hg19.fa ~/lava/lava_files/SNPs142_hg19_Common.filt.txt 
#still not sure which is correct...
